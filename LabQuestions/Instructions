In the 'Questions' folder you will see a file 'Questions.java'. Open and run it. 

This will output a series of questions from each of the labs to complete.

Modify this program to suit your needs, you can choose how many questions are outputted from each
array of questions. 

Copy the output and paste (as comments) into the 'Main' class in the 'Answers' folder. 

There are some extra classes in the 'Answers' folder, these will be needed for some of the
questions that need more than one class to complete.
